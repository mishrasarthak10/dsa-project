Data Structures and Algorithms project (IT-353).

It is a C++ project which is written in 2020 by Sarthak Mishra and Sanskar Sogani for Data Structures and Algorithms class.

It takes a text file and counts the words in that file and also returns the frequency of each word alphabetically. There is more information on Project Report.pdf file.

It is tested with the files which are under the example-txt-files directory. To use these text files, they have to be present in the same directory as the code.

Example usage: ./wordcounter.exe sonnets.txt
